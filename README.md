# roombloom
A study project 'zero to hero' diving into the hospitality industry software architechture, development and deployment.

Stack: Linux / Docker / Node.js / REST API / MySQL / HTML / CSS

<b>Couple words about myself:</b> 

I've always been a tech-savvy guy, curious about how things work, including network engineering, hardware and software. After trying to find my first hi-tech job I realised that the number of open entry-level positions is relatively small and companies look for a solid background and a stack of technologies in your pocket.
So I decided that I have to build a real-life useful project from scratch and will learn new things on the go. I expect this to take some time and a lot of effort, but I beleive that I can do it and I shall do it.

<b>The RoomBloom project: </b>

Today is the 23/02/2023 and I've decided to bring my 3-months Dana Analytics course graduate project to another level as I continue to study new technologies.
I will develop a web-based property management platform that could find it's use in hotels, resorts, real estate rentals, spa-centers, co-working spaces, etc.
The result will be a valuable tool for thousands of businesses across the globe. (Hopefully, he-he)

<b>What I have at the moment: </b>

I've built an efficient MySQL database structure with ERD that will manage:
- Guests (customers)
- Reservations
- Rooms
- Operations
- Agents
- Employees

<b>What's the plan: </b>

I have to learn and implement:
1. BACKEND
- How to use cloud infrastructure and deploy a server (Will choose AWS, GCP or Azure)
- How to work with Docker (images, containers, config, deployment, debugging)
- How to install MySQL server and create the database, entities, ERD
- How to write the backend API with Node.js (user authorization, connect to db, commands, services)

2. FRONTEND
- Web-based client-side interface development (CSS, HTML, JavaScript) 
- UX/UI
